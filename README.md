# DASPy

DASPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a python package for DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing) data processing.

The goal of the daspy project is to lower the bar of DAS data processing. DASPy includes:
* Classic seismic data processing techniques, including preprocessing, filter, spectrum analysis, and visualization
* Specialized algorithms for DAS applications, including denoising, waveform decomposition, channel attribute analysis, and strain-velocity conversion.
