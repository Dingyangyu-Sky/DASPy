# DASPy

DASPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a python package for DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing) data processing.

The goal of the daspy project is to lower the bar of DAS data processing. DASPy includes:
* Classic seismic data processing techniques, including preprocessing, filter, spectrum analysis, and visualization
* Specialized algorithms for DAS applications, including denoising, waveform decomposition, channel attribute analysis, and strain-velocity conversion. 

DASPy is licensed under the MIT License.

# Installation
DASPy is currently running on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
DASPy runs on Python 3.7 and up. We recommend you use the latest version of python 3 if possible.

```
conda install -c hmz-03 daspy
```
or
```
conda install hmz-03::daspy
```
