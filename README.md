# DASPy

DASPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a python package for DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing) applications. It provides seismological tools like earthquake detection, ambient noise tomography, fault detection. Some civil applications, like traffic detection, will be also involved in this project.

The goal of the daspy project is to 
1. to be updated
2.
